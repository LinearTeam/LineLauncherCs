## Line Launcher
**LineLauncher** is a cross-platform Fluent-style Minecraft launcher developed by [LinearTeam](https://github.com/LinearTeam), also abbreviated as LMC.  
This is its C# version repository. For the Visual Basic version, please refer to our [official website](https://line.icecreamteam.win).

The term "LMC" mentioned below refers to the C# version repository.

## Introduction
### History
The current `main` branch you are viewing is developed based on [Avalonia](https://docs.avaloniaui.net/). This UI framework differs from WPF, enabling native .NET cross-platform capabilities while maintaining UI design patterns similar to WPF.

LMC previously had a WPF version located in the `wpf` branch. Due to WPF's lack of cross-platform support and other limitations, we transitioned to Avalonia for cross-platform development.
